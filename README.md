# Katana Development Starter Kit

![Box of legos](leo.jpg)

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the **Katana Development Starter Kit**! This repository serves as
your launchpad for building on **Katana** and its testnet **Tatara**.

This kit provides:

- **Bun-based development environment** 🧅
- **Anvil + Foundry integration** for reliable local chain forks
- **Pre-configured build system** using Esbuild & TypeScript
- **[UI-kit CSS](https://getuikit.com/)**, optional to use
- **[viem](https://viem.sh/)** for blockchain interactions
- **Example contracts** to help you integrate with **Katana's money legos** and
  interfaces for all deployed contracts on Katana and Tatara
- **Foundry setup** for smart contract development and testing
- **Static File Handling** (HTML, CSS, and assets copied to `dist/`, easy to
  host on IPFS or any static file hosting service)
- **Local blockchain forks** for development with real contract states
- **Contract address mapping generator** for easy access to deployed contract
  addresses in JavaScript
- **Foundry MCP Server** for AI-assisted smart contract development with Cursor
- Script to generate a single file contract directory with all the ABIs,
  contract names, paths, descriptions, addresses, and context they belong to,
  for directory browsers like the [contract dir](https://contractdir.bruno.id)
- **Decentralised Hosting** on Arweave Name Service (ArNS) using permawed deploy package and `deploy-arns.yml` Github Workflow.

Whether you're building **yield strategies, cross-chain intent-based execution,
or novel DeFi protocols**, this starter kit helps you bootstrap your project
**fast**.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and add in your RPC endpoints.

Ensure you have the required tools installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Follow the installation instructions at <https://bun.sh/>
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for contract development and local
  chain forks
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

After installing Bun, run:

```sh
# Install project dependencies
bun install
```

### 2️⃣ **Run the Build System**

This project uses **Bun** as its runtime and **Esbuild** for bundling. To build
your project, run:

```sh
bun run build:all
```

This will:

- Compile and minify your TypeScript code
- Copy HTML & static assets to `./dist`
- Prepare the environment for deployment
- Compile helper utilities like an address-to-contract mapping in
  `utils/addresses.ts` and interface ABIs in the `/abis` folder
- Build the Foundry MCP server for AI-assisted development

Going forward, you can just rebuild the web app using `bun run build`.

### 3️⃣ **Local Chain Forking**

For local development with a Tatara testnet fork, you'll need to run two
commands in separate terminals:

#### Terminal 1: Start Anvil Fork

```sh
bun run start:anvil:tatara
```

#### Terminal 2: Verify the Fork

```sh
bun run verify:anvil:tatara
```

This creates a local fork of Tatara at `http://localhost:8545` that you can
connect to with MetaMask (Chain ID: 471).

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for more details.

### 4️⃣ **Example dApp**

The starter kit includes a simple example dApp that connects to the Tatara
testnet (or your local fork) and displays information about key contracts.

To run the example:

1. Start your local Tatara fork (in its own terminal):

   ```sh
   bun run start:anvil:tatara
   ```

2. In a new terminal, build the dApp:

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

3. Serve `dist/index.html` in your browser with something like
   `cd dist && npx http-server`

The example dApp shows:

- AUSD token information
- WETH token information
- MorphoBlue protocol information

You can use this as a starting point for your own dApp development.

### 5️⃣ **Using the Foundry MCP Server**

The kit includes a Foundry MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables
AI-assisted smart contract and app development when used with compatible AI
tools like Cursor.

To use the MCP server:

1. Configure e.g. Cursor to use the MCP server by adding the following to your Cursor
   config in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

   ```json
   "mcpServers": {
     "foundry": {
       "command": "bun run",
       "args": [
         "/absolute_path_to_starter_kit/dist-mcp/index.js"
       ],
       "env": {
         "PRIVATE_KEY": "0xYourPrivateKeyHere",
         "RPC_URL": "http://localhost:8545"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `/absolute_path_to_starter_kit/` with absolute path to your clone of
   the starter kit.

2. Launch the local chain with `bun run start:anvil:tatara`.

3. The `PRIVATE_KEY` and `RPC_URL` environment variables are optional. If not
   provided, the RPC URL will default to `http://localhost:8545`.

4. After configuring, you can use the AI in Cursor to interact with Foundry
   tools, including:
   - Calling contract functions
   - Checking balances
   - Starting/stopping Anvil instances
   - Creating and deploying smart contracts
   - Working with Katana-specific contracts

The MCP server provides a seamless interface between AI tools and Foundry's
blockchain development toolkit, making it easier to build and interact with
contracts on Katana.

### 6️⃣ **Contract Address Mapping**

The kit includes a utility to generate a JavaScript mapping of all contract
addresses for both Tatara testnet and Katana mainnet (when available). This
makes it easy to access contract addresses in your frontend code without
hardcoding them.

To generate the address mapping:

```sh
bun run build:addresses
```

This will create a file at `utils/addresses.ts` that exports:

- `CHAIN_IDS` - An object with chain ID constants
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES` - A mapping of all contract names to their addresses on
  both networks
- `getContractAddress(contractName, chainId)` - A utility function to get the
  correct address for a contract on a specific network

Example usage in your JavaScript/TypeScript code:

```javascript
import getContractAddress, { CHAIN_IDS } from '../utils/addresses';

// Get WETH address for the current network
const chainId = 471; // Tatara testnet
const wethAddress = getContractAddress('WETH', chainId);

// Or use the CHAIN_IDS constants
const morphoAddress = getContractAddress('MorphoBlue', CHAIN_IDS.TATARA);
```

The address mapping is generated from the Solidity address libraries in the
interfaces directory.

### 7️⃣ Decentralised Hosting on Arweave Name System (ArNS)

This kit includes the `permaweb-deploy` package and `deploy-arns.yml` Github Workflow for decentralized static hosting on [Arweave Name System (ArNS)](https://ar.io/arns):

To host your app on ArNS follw these steps:

1. **Create & top-up your Arweave Wallet:** head to [Wander](https://www.wander.app/) to create a new wallet and then top up this wallet with [Turbo Credits](https://turbo-topup.com/) using Fiat or AR to pay for uploads.
2. **Purchase an ArNS Name:**
    - Head to the [ArNS app](https://arns.app) to purchase a name (supports [ARIO](https://ar.io/token), Credit Card and Turbo Credits)
    - Optionally purchase a testnet name by requesting `tARIO` tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.arweave.net/) and following the "Using arns.app with Testnet" section of [this guide](https://docs.ar.io/guides/testnet) to purchase a testnet name.
3. **Configure .Github Secrets**
    - Go to your repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
    - Create a new GH secret `DEPLOY_KEY`
    - Download your wallets keyfile from Wander.
    - Convert this file to base64 and copy to clipboard `base64 -i wallet.json | pbcopy`
    - Paste this as the value for `DEPLOY_KEY`
4. **Update deployment script and deploy:**
    - Replace the value for `specialk` in `deploy:arweave` script in `package.json` to the name you purchased earlier.
    - Commit changes to Git and push to Github.

To deploy manually via the CLI use the following command:

```
DEPLOY_KEY=$(base64 -i wallet.json) npx permaweb-deploy --arns-name <ARNS_NAME>
```

NB - To use a testnet ArNS name, update the value for `<ARNS_NAME>` to your testnet name and append `--ario-process testnet` to the end of the `deploy:arweave` script in `package.json` or the CLI Script above.
